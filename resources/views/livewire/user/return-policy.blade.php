                         <ul>
                             <li>The supply of Goods made to Your specifications or clearly personalized.</li>
                             <li>The supply of Goods which according to their nature are not suitable to be
                                 returned, deteriorate rapidly or where the date of expiry is over.</li>
                             <li>The supply of Goods which are not suitable for return due to health protection
                                 or hygiene reasons and were unsealed after delivery.</li>

                                 inseparably mixed with other items.</li>
                         </ul>
                         <p>We reserve the right to refuse returns of any merchandise that does not meet the
                             above return conditions in our sole discretion.</p>
                         <p>Only regular priced Goods may be refunded. Unfortunately, Goods on sale cannot be
                             refunded. This exclusion may not apply to You if it is not permitted by applicable
                             law.</p>
                         <h4 class="mb-2 mt-40">Returning Goods</h4>
                         <p>You are responsible for the cost and risk of returning the Goods to Us. You should
                             send the Goods at the following address:</p>
                         <p>The Delivery Boy will pick it up</p>

                             Therefore, We recommend an insured and trackable mail service. We are unable to
                             issue a refund without actual receipt of the Goods or proof of received return
                             delivery.</p>
                         <h4 class="mb-2 mt-40">Gifts</h4>
                         <p>If the Goods were marked as a gift when purchased and then shipped directly to you,
                             You'll receive a gift credit for the value of your return. Once the returned
                             product is received, a gift certificate will be mailed to You.</p>
                         <p>If the Goods weren't marked as a gift when purchased, or the gift giver had the
                             Order shipped to themselves to give it to You later, We will send the refund to the
                             gift giver.</p>
